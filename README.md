This Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and
JavaScript. Students are always stressed so this helps in regards to that and keeps them orginised and confiddnt in accessing notes they have learnt throughout their prework.I learnt that it is not easy to build a website however it is possible and quite fun.
